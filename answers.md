### Example of when this structure does not work well. How can you improve it?

A structure where whis wouldn't work well would be a sentence that asks for reasoning, the bot can't repond to a reason with another reason. The bot doesn't have enough information to give a respose back to the reason the user is asking. 

ex: Why is that vacum charging?


You could improve it by make the bot more aware, that could make thing become much more complicated. It could search for the why keyword and return "because it is" or "life has it's way", this could add character to the bot while keeping the code simple for it's purpose.
